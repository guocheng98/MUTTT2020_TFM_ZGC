## Fine-tune a Neural Machine Translation Model for Legal Domain: theories explained and practice with Hugging Face

*Fine-tuned model pushed to Hugging Face ü§ó Hub: https://huggingface.co/guocheng98/HelsinkiNLP-FineTuned-Legal-es-zh*

This repo functions as complementary materials of the author's master thesis. It contains codes for the Methodology chapter and part of the parallel corpus files.

1. ChinaLawInfo_Spanish: Spanish translations found on *BOE (Bolet√≠n Oficial del Estado)* and EUR-Lex of files downloaded from *China Law Info (ÂåóÂ§ßÊ≥ïÂÆù Beida Fabao)*.
2. CivilCode_Spanish: Spanish Civil Code parsed from an HTML file. The folder contains the HTML file (BOE.html), the processing code (Processing codes.ipynb), and the TXT files obtained.
3. Constitution: the original text of Spanish Constitution and its translation into Simplified Chinese.
4. Extract data from TMX.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file; code of extracting structurally the textual information from the translation memory file.
5. HuggingFace_Fine-tune.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file; code of the whole fine-tuning process.
6. HuggingFace_gettingtranslation.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file; code of the inference stage where we obtain the machine translation outputs of the original and the fine-tuned models.
7. Other TXT files:
7.1. Test_es.txt:
    a. Spanish part of the test set.
    b. Test_zh.txt: Simplified Chinese part of the test set.
    c. Translation_FT.txt: machine translation outputs of the fine-tuned model, with Test_es.txt as the source text.
    d. Translation_original.txt: machine translation outputs of the original model, with Test_es.txt as the source text.
